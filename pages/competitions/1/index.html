    <p>
        Welcome to the first ever URCL coding competition! ðŸŽŠ  <br>  
        Each competition will be announced a day earlier and start at the time specified by the announcement post.
        The theme and specifications/restrictions will be released right when it starts. 
        There will be no prize, but if genius solutions are presented to complex themes you may get the chance to get @Certified URCL Wizard rank.
    </p>
    <p>
        To program your solution you may use any tool you want, from compilers, syntax highlighters, or emulators. The output must be a runnable urcl code.
    </p>
    <p>
        The submitted program must be open source, and can be freely used. Taking credit for it is not allowed. <br><br>

        To submit your program send a share URL to <a href="./">the to be created thread</a>
        along with a link to the source code (on github) and ask a mod to pin it for you. <br><br>
        
        If you also have the urcl online you can also use a link to that in your shared link. <br>
